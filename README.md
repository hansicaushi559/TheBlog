# TheBlog


I developed this project using Django for the backend and React for the frontend. For the backend, I utilized Django's built-in SQLite database and ORM to store user information within the "Users App" and blog post data in the "Blog Model."
The project also includes a search feature that allows users to find specific posts. To access the posts, you'll need to log in using JWT tokens. If you don't have an account, you can easily create one. Once logged in, your name will appear in the navbar, and you can log out whenever you need to.
When you click on a post, it will open in a single-page view. I've ensured that the app is designed to work seamlessly on various devices, including both desktop and mobile.
