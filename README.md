# TheBlog

This project combines Django for the backend and React for the frontend. The backend uses Django's built-in SQLite database and ORM to store user information in the "Users App" and blog post data in the "Blog Model."
There's a search feature that allows users to find specific posts. To access the posts, users need to log in using JWT tokens. If you don't have an account, you can easily create one. Once logged in, your name appears in the navbar, and you can log out whenever needed.
When you click on a post, it opens in a single-page view. The app is designed to work well on various devices, including both desktop and mobile.
